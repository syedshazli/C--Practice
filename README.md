# C++ Practice
From the Textbook "C++ guide" along with other things related to C++ I find interesting, such as implementations of operating system & computer architecture concepts (such as pipelining and process shceduling)
## CUDA Practice
This repo also contains cuda stuff I find interesting for CUDA C. May be implementing in a separate repo later.
